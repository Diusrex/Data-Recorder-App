Data-Recorder-App
=================

The purpose of this app is to allow the user to easily track important data, and then later import this data into excel or other related programs.

Release
-----------------

I have not released this app on the Google Play Store due to a lack of time. The app is working, I just did not manage to create a description as well as have sufficient help/information screens before school started. I will release the app once I have time, likely in mid December.


Naming
-----------------

Within the code, there are three different types of information:

* Category: Is basically a container for questions for how the data will be saved.
* Question: One of the questions that a user will answer when entering data.
* Data Row: Completed set of questions.
